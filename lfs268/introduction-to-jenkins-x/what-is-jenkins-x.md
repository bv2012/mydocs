# What Is Jenkins X

Jenkins X is an open source tool for automating CI/CD workflow for the cloud native world. Its main focus is to achieve developer productivity through automation, tooling and DevOps best practices. Jenkins X is heavily influenced by the State of DevOps reports and the [_"Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps - Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations"_](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) book by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim. In this book, the authors identified a number of capabilities of high performing software teams. Jenkins X provides an automated way of implementing those capabilities.

Jenkins X was launched in 2018 as a subproject of [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) - a wildly popular open source CI/CD tool. However, there are no real similarities between Jenkins and Jenkins X. Both are CI/CD servers but they have different approaches. Jenkins is a multi-faceted and multi-configurable tool that can run anywhere and can be configured to do multiple things, whereas Jenkins X is specifically designed for CI/CD of microservices-based architecture on Kubernetes. At the time of its inception, Jenkins X creators chose Jenkins as pipeline execution engine. As a result, Jenkinsfile-based pipelines could run on Jenkins X. That has now changed. Since April 2020, [Tekton](https://cloud.google.com/tekton) has replaced Jenkins as a pipeline execution engine. This means Tekton's YML-based pipelines are now the only way to create CI/CD workflows in Jenkins X.

The Jenkins X project is hosted by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](https://cd.foundation) (CDF) - a hosted project of the Linux Foundation. You can find more information about CDF in the course _"Introduction"_ chapter.

Jenkins X is a fast-moving project. At the time this course is being updated (November 2021), version 2.x is deprecated and 3.x is the major supported version. If you have used 2.x in the past, please refer to this document [_"Comparison of Jenkins X version 3.x to 2.x"_](https://jenkins-x.io/v3/about/comparison/) for a comparison between these two versions. This class is based on features and capabilities of Jenkins 3.x.
