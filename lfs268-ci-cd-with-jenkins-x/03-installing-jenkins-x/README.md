# 03 Installing Jenkins X

Jenkins X installation is a fairly straightforward task. The installation requires a functional Kubernetes cluster. Jenkins X provides seamless integration with major cloud vendors and lets you quickly build a cluster. In this chapter, we will discuss how to prepare the Jenkins X environment.

## Jenkins X Prerequisites

Before starting the installation process, you will need:

* A Git binary installed on your computer
* A GitHub user account

Jenkins X stores Kubernetes cluster configuration in a Git repository and it supports a variety of Git repository hosting tools like GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, etc. In this course however, we will only use GitHub. If you donâ€™t already have a GitHub account, you can sign up for free [here](https://github.com).

You will also need a Git client installed on your local machine. Please follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to install it on your preferred choice of operating system.
