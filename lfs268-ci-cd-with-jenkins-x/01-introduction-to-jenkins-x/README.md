# 01 Introduction to Jenkins X

The last few years have seen quite a few changes in the software industry. Several interesting trends have emerged. Container images have become a widely accepted way of distributing software. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for operating container clusters. Microservices and cloud-native applications have gained popularity resulting in a massive increase in the number of components that require CI/CD. The annual [Accelerate State of DevOps Report](https://services.google.com/fh/files/misc/state-of-devops-2019.pdf) survey has indicated that high performing teams focus on rapid delivery of value to customers. It has become clear that the future of software delivery will include Kubernetes, Microservices and scripted pipeline-based workflows. Jenkins X is a step in this direction. In this chapter, we will further explore Jenkins X.
