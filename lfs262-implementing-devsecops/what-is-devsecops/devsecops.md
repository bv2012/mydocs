# DevSecOps

### What is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps commonly refers to the set of practices that are incorporated into the software delivery pipeline to provide early feedback on security risks and help you mitigate those risks before even delivering the software. These risks could be related to vulnerabilities in the actual application code, or components which make up the software, or even the infrastructure pieces used to deploy the application with.

DevSecOps attempts to embed security into the DevOps process and makes it a shared responsibility to allow deployments to be carried out at a fast pace while ensuring that the applications deployed have high levels of reliability and security.

DevSecOps tries to fill the security gaps introduced due to either:

* **Inexperience**\
  Inexperienced teams implementing DevOps may introduce manual processes that hinder the pace of deployment.
* **Immaturity**\
  Immature DevOps implementers would completely bypass security over the speed of deployment, which risks introducing vulnerabilities at scale.

DevSecOps attempts to embed security checks as part of the DevOps Pipeline instead of security being at the end of the pipeline stifling the pace of delivery.



### Implementing DevSecOps

Below is a step-by-step recipe to implement DevSecOps in your organization:

1. Adapt to **security as a culture**. Security is not the job of a specific team which is designated to perform the InfoSec role, but it becomes a collaborative effort as developers and operations teams consider it at every phase of the delivery pipeline.
2. Analyze the **layers of your application** infrastructure for risks and come up with strategies to mitigate those risks.
3. Embed security practices into the **continuous delivery** pipelines leading to the creation of DevSecOps pipelines.
4. Create dedicated, automated **SecOps pipelines** for infrastructure and operational security practices.
5. Set up **runtime security monitoring**. Introducing preventive measures along with reactive measures, such as runtime monitoring, can help you create a holistic security plan.
