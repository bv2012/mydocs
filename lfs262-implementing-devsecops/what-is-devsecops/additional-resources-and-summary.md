## Chapter Summary

This chapter should have helped you build a conceptual foundation about DevSecOpsâ€”why it is important, how it relates to the way modern, cloud native applications are designed, packaged and deployed, what are the risks introduced by such applications, and the methodology prescribed (this is where DevSecOps comes into play) to mitigate such risks. You have been introduced to common DevSecOps practices, which you are going to start implementing to build a case study during the rest of this course. Your journey with DevSecOps has just begun!
